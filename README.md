# Cardiovascular-Disease-classification
Project implements cardiovascular disease classifier using ANN and Random Forest.

### Model

Model runs on an algorithm based on Artificial Intelligence using Google's Machine learning framework TensorFlow.

The algorithm is trained on the dataset provided by UCI ML repo(Cleveland dataset) that contains 13 attributes to classify the presence/absence of Cardiovascular disease.
